# script2Bit
    script2Bit is a script conversion software for 
    film makers and producers making Call Sheets and 
    Production Reports Fast, Easy, and Free.

## Synopsis
We are building an automation tool for film makers and producers that creates scheduling agents from **a movie script**. This tool efficiently breaks down a script into components for use in creating call sheets, SMS, email notices and other vital elements of movie production. 



## Usage

### script2Bit converts Screenplay into Call Sheet.

See the sample project for a simple example of how the script conversion works.

TODO: Write usage instructions

## Code Example

TODO: Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

Film makers often cite the biggest challenge in productions as building schedules from movie scripts. Our tool will reduce the manual data entry of call sheets, and will automatically notify cast and crew members when they are needed on set.

2. `npm install`
3. `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
4. `npm install bower`
5. `bower install`
6. `grunt serve`

### Web
